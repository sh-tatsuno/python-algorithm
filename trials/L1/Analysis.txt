# Runtime Analysis

## Task 0

In Task 0, the program only access the first and last part of lists.
Thus, excluding reading parts (with ~), the order of main part is O(1).

## Task 1
I use set function to add the unique telephone number.
Set function can add by O(1), so in total, the order is O(N_text + N_call) => O(N).

## Task 2
I use dict function to sum the duraion of time.
Set function can search key by O(1), and at last, I search the most biggest value and correspondent key.
The order of the runtime would bw O(N).

## Task 3
I first define the function to extract prefix (this would be O(1)).
For loop is used only once in calls, and sort function is used also once.
I use sort function in the last. In worst case, the complexity of sort function is O(NlogN).  
Finally, the order would be O(NlogN).

## Task 4
I also use set function and iteration in text and call data.
Order of each loop is O(N), and sort function is used in the last.
so the total order is also O(NlogN).
