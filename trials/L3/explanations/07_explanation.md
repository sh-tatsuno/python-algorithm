This is close to problem_05, so the main algorithm is same to this.
Different from previous problem, this focuses on the path, so I have implemented url split function to build a trie struct.  
Also, For accepting the last value of '/', I also have written the trim algorithm.

The order is O(N) and test cases are total 5.
