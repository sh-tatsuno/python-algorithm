I have first made a sort function of LinkedList (O(N)).
Next, after using sort function, I iterate each link and choose smaller value.

This is very close to 2 functions, union and intersection.
The calculationtime is decided by the time of sort() function.

So, it is to say that the order is usual O(N(logN))
